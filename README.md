# Data analysis for Jonathan Gitzendanner Project

## AICE Environmental Science

### Author: Matt Gitzendanner

The data files and script in this repository are supplemental data for Jonathan Gitzendanner's AICE Environmental Science project studying Chlorphyll A and Nitrate levels at 10 sampling sites using data from the South West Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD).

Jonathan developed the project, located the data and downloaded the data on his own.

The data files as downloaded from SWFWMD are in a format that is difficult to analyze directly. For each sampling location, there is one file for each chemical and one line for the dates that chemical was analyzed. The chemicals were not analyzed on the same dates in all cases. 

Jonathan wanted to find the dates where both chemicals were analyzed on the same day. This seemed like a challenging task using Excel or other methods. As such, Matt Gitzendanner, Jonathan's father, wrote a Phython script to do the data conversion. The output of the script was then returned to Jonathan who finished the summary of the data and all subsequent analyses.

The data and Python script are being provided as an example of open science and full disclosure of what he did vs what part he had assistance with.

Jonathan did not have any roll in coding the Python script and it should not be considered as part of his project.
